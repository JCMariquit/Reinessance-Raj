    <h2>History of the Renaissance</h2>
    <div class="history-content">
      <p>The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political, and economic "rebirth" following the Middle Ages, spanning from the 14th to the 17th century. It originated in Italy, particularly in Florence, and was marked by a renewed interest in the classical art, literature, and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome. This era is known for transforming almost every aspect of European society, from art and science to politics and religion.</p>
      
      <h3>Characteristics of the Renaissance</h3>
      <p>The Renaissance was characterized by humanism, an intellectual movement that placed human experience, education, and individual achievement at the forefront. People began to question traditional authority and value individual thinking, leading to advancements in science, art, and philosophy.</p>
      
      <h3>Notable Achievements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Art:</strong> Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael pioneered techniques such as perspective, shading, and anatomical accuracy, producing masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa and the Sistine Chapel ceiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> Figures like Galileo Galilei and Nicolaus Copernicus challenged established views, promoting the heliocentric model of the universe and laying foundations for modern astronomy.</li>
        <li><strong>Literature:</strong> Writers like Dante, Petrarch, and Machiavelli produced influential works. Notably, Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i> bridged classical and modern literature, and Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i> provided a new approach to political philosophy.</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Renaissance architecture, led by architects like Brunelleschi and Alberti, introduced symmetry, proportion, and geometry inspired by classical Roman buildings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact on Society</h3>
      <p>The Renaissance brought profound societal change, influencing Europe’s transition from feudalism to early modern structures. This shift affected art, politics, religion, and science, laying the groundwork for the Enlightenment and later modern thinking.</p>
      
      <p>By the 17th century, Renaissance ideals had spread across Europe, influencing everything from literature to education, and encouraging explorations that eventually led to the discovery of new continents. Its legacy remains today, celebrated as a period of unparalleled creativity and intellectual achievement.</p>
